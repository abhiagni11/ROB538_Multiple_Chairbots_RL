# ROB538_Multiple_Chairbots_RL
Multiagent learning for multiple chairbots in a restaurant setting. This code includes the basic structure for DQN learning using Pytorch.

In this codebase:
*restaurant.py* contains the environment class.
*agent.py* contains the agent class.
*DQN.py* contains the deep q-network classes, which uses Pytorch.
*main.py* is used to run the simulation.
